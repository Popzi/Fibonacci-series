# Fibonacci series

This script was written in the course Logic and Maths for Computing.
The task was to write a script that would take into account both iterative and recursive fibonacci sequence generation and measure the time of generating. I must warn that this script is not the best example of following standard naming conventions but I will blame it on being a student and not knowing better :-)

### Run the script
This script is interactive and will ask questions upon running it.
```python
$ python fibonacci.py
```
